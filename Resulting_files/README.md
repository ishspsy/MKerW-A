# Overview

This directory consists of the following three subdirectories that
include main result files related to main clustering analysis.

## Subdirectory

- [Clusters_index](https://github.com/ishspsy/MKerW-A/blob/master/Resulting_files/Clusters_index):
this directory contains clustering results for the various cancer types from TCGA data


-- [clsnumber_set.mat](https://github.com/ishspsy/MKerW-A/blob/master/Resulting_files/Clusters_index/clsnumber_set.mat) : 
this file includes target clustering numbers for each of the cancer types

-- [surv_analysis_mu1_lam0001_i_norandom.mat](https://github.com/ishspsy/MKerW-A/blob/master/Resulting_files/Clusters_index/surv_analysis_mu1_lam0001_1_norandom.mat) : for the cancer type index i, this file includes clustering results for various clustering methods. These files are generated from
[main_real.m](https://github.com/ishspsy/MKerW-A/main_real.m)

-- [Index_csv](https://github.com/ishspsy/MKerW-A/blob/master/Resulting_files/Clusters_index/Index_csv) : 
this subdirectory contain csv files (e.g. cancer1.csv for the cancer type 1) including obtained cluster indices for each of the clustering methods.
These files are just generated by the "surv_analysis_mu1_lam0001_i_norandom.mat" file for convenience



- [Simulation_results](https://github.com/ishspsy/MKerW-A/blob/master/Resulting_files/Simulation_results)
:  this directory contains clustering results for the simulation data

- [Survival_results](https://github.com/ishspsy/MKerW-A/blob/master/Resulting_files/Survival_results)
: this directory contains survival analysis with respect to obtained clustering results
for the real TCGA data
