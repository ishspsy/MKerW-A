This is a matlab implementation of the paper published in Nature Methods titled as "Visualization and analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data by kernel-based similarity learning".

OVERVIEW

Single-cell RNA-seq technologies enable high throughput gene expression measurement of individual cells, and allow the discovery of heterogeneity within cell populations. Measurement of cell-to-cell gene expression similarity is critical to identification, visualization and analysis of cell populations. However, single-cell data introduce challenges to conventional measures of gene expression similarity because of the high level of noise, outliers and dropouts. We develop a novel similarity-learning framework, SIMLR (Single-cell Interpretation via Multi-kernel LeaRning), which learns an appropriate distance metric from the data for dimension reduction, clustering and visualization. SIMLR is capable of separating known subpopulations more accurately in single-cell data sets than do existing dimension reduction methods. Additionally, SIMLR demonstrates high sensitivity and accuracy on high-throughput peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) data sets generated by the GemCode single-cell technology from 10x Genomics. 


IMPLEMENTATIONS
We provide implementations of SIMLR for both small scale and large scale. With small dataset (e.g, dataset with less than 3,000 cells), we recommend the user to use the function called "SIMLR". For Large dataset (with more than 3,000 cells), we recommend the user to use the function called "SIMLR_LARGE".  

 
INSTALLATIONS
Before running SIMLR, the user needs to mex compile serveral C-mex files. You can simply run the code INSTALL_SIMLR.m and then enjoy!


DEMO
We provide two demos for the usage of SIMLR in both small scale and large scale. In main_demo.m we run SIMLR on four small-scale datasets in our paper. And in main_LARGE_demo.m, we show an example of how to run our SIMLR in large scale.
