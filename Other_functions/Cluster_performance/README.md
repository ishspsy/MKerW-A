# Overview

This directory includes supplementary functions that related to clustering analysis in the paper.

## Codes


- [Contingency.m](https://github.com/ishspsy/MKerW-A/blob/master/Other_functions/Cluster_performance/Contingency.m)
: this code forms contingency matrix for two vectors. Used for computing ARI value. 
This code is written by David Corney (2000). 

- [RandIndex.m](https://github.com/ishspsy/MKerW-A/blob/master/Other_functions/Cluster_performance/RandIndex.m)
: this code calculates Rand Indices (ARI) to compare two partitions. This code is written by David Corney (2000). 

- [cal_normalized_purtiy.m](https://github.com/ishspsy/MKerW-A/blob/master/Other_functions/Cluster_performance/cal_normalized_purtiy.m)
: this code computes average values and standard deviations of the cluster performances (e.g. NMI, purity, ARI)
for the randomly assigned clusters given each target cluster numbers from 2 to 30.


- [diff_area_func_ave.m](https://github.com/ishspsy/MKerW-A/blob/master/Other_functions/Cluster_performance/diff_area_func_ave.m)
: this code computes the differences of the fitted survival curves of each cluster in terms of curves of all patients.

- [diff_area_func.m](https://github.com/ishspsy/MKerW-A/blob/master/Other_functions/Cluster_performance/diff_area_func.m)
: this code computes the absolute area between two fitted survival curves.

- [diff_area_func2.m](https://github.com/ishspsy/MKerW-A/blob/master/Other_functions/Cluster_performance/diff_area_func2.m)
: this code computes the relative area of the fitted survival curves.  

- [generate_surv_func_general.m](https://github.com/ishspsy/MKerW-A/blob/master/Other_functions/Cluster_performance/generate_surv_func_general.m)
: this function provides the fitted Weibull survival curve for each subgroup. 

- [purity.m](https://github.com/ishspsy/MKerW-A/blob/master/Other_functions/Cluster_performance/purity.m)
: this code computes a purity between two clustering labels.

- [reg_pca.m](https://github.com/ishspsy/MKerW-A/blob/master/Other_functions/Cluster_performance/reg_pca.m)
: this code performs PCA analysis.
