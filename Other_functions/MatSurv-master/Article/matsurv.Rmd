# Summary

Survival analysis is a key tool in bioinformatics today. Common aspects of survival analysis include log rank tests, Hazard Ratios (HR) and Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves. KM-curves are used to display suvival durations between two groups and give users a rough estimate of survival probability at a given time; log rank tests are used to compare suvival durations between groups and HRs is a ratio of the hazard rates between groups. MATLAB (MATLAB 2018A) is currently missing functions to easily create a KM-plot with accompanying risk-table or with multiple groups.  Furthermore, MATLAB does not have a built-in log rank test, neither is one available in any of the toolboxes, including the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox. Our goal for MatSurv is to provide an easy-to-use function that creates a publication quality KM-plot, with a risk table, and produces accurate statistics for multiple groups. Users can also easily modify the appearance of the created KM figure. The graphics were inspried by the ``survminer`` R-package [@survminer]. 

MatSurv uses the Mantel-Cox, sometimes called the Mantel-Haenszel, log rank test. The HR calculations use the log rank approach, HR = (Oa/Ea)/(Ob/Eb), where Oa & Ob are the observed events in each group and Ea & Eb are the number of expected events.  This will give slightly different results when compared to the Mantel-Haneszel or Cox regression approach, which is commonly used in R. 

In order to use MatSurv, simply put MatSurv.m in any directory of your choice and make sure it is added to your path. At a minimum, the user should provide ``TimeVar``, a vector with numeric time to event, either observed or censored, ``EventVar``, a vector or cell array defining events or censoring, and ``GroupVar``, a vector or cell array defining the comparison groups (see example code below). 

```matlab
load laml_RC_data.mat

[p,fh,stats]=MatSurv(laml_RC_TimeVar, laml_RC_EventVar,  laml_RC_GroupVar,...
'GroupsToUse', {'Good','Intermediate','Poor'},'Xstep',24);
```

The function returns three pieces ``p``, the log rank p-value, ``fh``, the KM-plot figure handle, and ``stats``, which are additional statistics from the log rank test. The user can further customize the style of their KM-plot (line colors, labels, ticks, etc.) by making changes to the figure handle. 

The results from the MatSurv log rank test have been compared against both SAS and R and found to return the same results (Table 1).
